# 🍴 Food Delivery System

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents and develops a **Restaurant Browsing and Food Delivery System**.  
The project simulates how modern food delivery applications (like Talabat, Uber Eats, or Deliveroo) work — from **browsing restaurants** to **adding items to cart**, **checkout**, **payment**, and **delivery tracking**.  

The goal is to extract **requirements, features, and functionalities** for each module, then gradually build **use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and system design**, and finally move toward implementation.
